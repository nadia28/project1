##Story of the Game
* The "Let's have some cheese" game is created to train the user's memory in a funny interactive way.
* The goal is to remember as many squares that have "cheese" in them and score as many points as possible.
* The limitations that lead the game to be over are the timer and the trap where "Tom" is hidden.
* The "Let's have some cheese" is a two player game, where the results are compared after the second player finishes the game.
* The winner can be displayed by clicking on "The Winner Is" button.

##User Stories:
* As a user, when I open the game, I see a "start" button, a board of squares and a "The winner is" button.
* The timer board is set up to 10 seconds and a score board shows 0.
* As a user, when I click on "start" button, I see the content of the squares fade in for some period of time,  and then fade out again.
* As a user, I use that time to remember the content of the board.
* As a user, I notice that after all the pictures fade out, the timer starts counting down. 
* As a user, I need to open as many "cheese" squares as possible and not to open a square with "Tom", because this will end the game.
* As a user I, when I hit "cheese", the score board adds 1 point.
* As a user, when I hit "clock" the timer adds 2 seconds to a timer and keeps counting down.
* As a user, I also notice a "message-box" with announcements, their content depends on type of square you click on.
* As a user, I know the game also finishes when the time is over.
* As a user, when I hit "Tom" or my time finishes, the switches to other player.
* As a user, after the other player stops the game, the scores of both are compared and the winner is declared by clicking on "The Winner is" button.


##Future Development
* As a player, I want to have several rounds of the game.
* As a player, I want to see number of squares grow every round and timer go faster.
* As a player, I want to be able to enter my name
* As a player, I want the winner be declared without clicking on the button
* Simplify the code
